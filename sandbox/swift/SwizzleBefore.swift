 # SwizzleBefore.swift

 Code that is hidden to students but is swizzled together with their code when
 they click "Submit".

 Use this section to insert any code that should come before student code
 like setup, extending built-in classes (ex. to remove functionality), etc.

 - Important: When necessary, use obfuscated names that will not conflict
 with student code.
